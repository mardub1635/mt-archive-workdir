Phoneme-based transliteration of foreign names for OOV problem	Wei Gao and Kam-Fai Wong and Wai Lam				110-119	"            A proper noun dictionary is never complete rendering name
translation from English to Chinese ineffective. One way to solve this problem
is not to rely on a dictionary alone but to adopt automatic translation
according to pronunciation similarities, i.e. to map phonemes comprising an
English name to the phonetic representations of the corresponding Chinese name.
This process is called transliteration. We present a statistical
transliteration method. An efficient algorithm for aligning phoneme chunks is
described. Unlike rule-based approaches, our method is data-driven. Compared to
source-channel based statistical approaches, we adopt a direct transliteration
model, i.e. the direction of probabilistic estimation conforms to the
transliteration direction. We demonstrate comparable performance to
source-channel based system."	Selected abstracts
Building a parallel bilingual syntactically annotated corpus	Jan Cuřin and Martin Čmejrek and Jiří Havelka and Vladislav Kuboň				168-176	"            This paper describes a process of building a bilingual
syntactically annotated corpus, the PCEDT (Prague Czech-English Dependency
Treebank). The corpus is being created at Charles
University, Prague, and the release of this corpus as
Linguistic Data Consortium data collection is scheduled for the spring of 2004.
The paper discusses important decisions made prior to the start of the project
and gives an overview of all kinds of resources included in the PCEDT."	Selected abstracts
Acquiring bilingual named entity translations from content-aligned corpora	Tadashi Kumano and Hideki Kashioka and Hideki Tanaka and Takahiro Fukusima				177-186	"            We propose a new method for acquiring bilingual named
entity (NE) translations from non-literal, content-aligned corpora. It first
recognizes NEs in each of a bilingual document pair
using the NE extraction technique, then finds NE groups whose members share the
same referent, and finally corresponds between bilingual NE groups. The exhaustive
detection of NEs can potentially acquire translation
pairs with broad coverage. The correspondences between bilingual NE groups are
estimated based on the similarity of the appearance order in each document, and
the corresponding performance came up to F(=1)
= 71.0% by using small bilingual dictionary together. The total performance for
acquiring bilingual NE pairs through the overall process of extraction,
grouping, and corresponding was F(=1) = 58.8%."	Selected abstracts
Example-based machine translation without saying inferable predicate	Eiji Aramaki and Sadao Kurohashi and Hideki Kashioka and Hideki Tanaka				206-215	"            For natural translations, a human being does not express
predicates that are inferable from the context in a target language. This paper
proposes a method of machine translation which handles these predicates. First,
to investigate how to translate them, we build a corpus in which predicate
correspondences are annotated manually. Then, we observe the corpus, and find
alignment patterns including these predicates. In our experimental results, the
machine translation system using the patterns demonstrated the basic
feasibility of our approach."	Selected abstracts
Improving back-transliteration by combining information sources	Slaven Bilac and Hozumi Tanaka				216-223	"            Transliterating words and names from one language to
another is a frequent and highly productive phenomenon. Transliteration is
information loosing since important distinctions are not preserved in the
process. Hence, automatically converting transliterated words back into their
original form is a real challenge. However, due to wide applicability in MT and
CLIR, it is a computationally interesting problem. Previously proposed
back-transliteration methods are based either on phoneme modeling
or grapheme modeling across languages. In this paper,
we propose a new method, combining the two models in order to enhance the
back–transliterations of words transliterated in Japanese. Our experiments show
that the resulting system outperforms single-model systems."	Selected abstracts
Bilingual sentence alignment based on punctuation statistics and lexicon	Thomas C.Chuang and Jian-Cheng Wu and Tracy Lin and Wen-chie Shei and Jason S.Chang				224-232	"            This paper presents a new method of aligning bilingual
parallel texts based on punctuation statistics and lexical information. It is
demonstrated that the punctuation statistics prove to be effective means to
achieve good results. The task of sentence alignment of bilingual texts written
in disparate language pairs like English and Chinese is reportedly more
difficult. We examine the feasibility of using punctuations for high accuracy
sentence alignment. Encouraging precision rate is demonstrated in aligning
sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based solely on punctuation statistics.
Improved results were obtained when both punctuation statistics and lexical
information were employed. We have experimented with an implementation of the
proposed method on the parallel corpora of Sinorama
Magazine and Records of the Hong Kong Legislative Council with satisfactory
results."	Selected abstracts
Automatic learning of parallel dependency treelet pairs	Yuan Ding and Martha Palmer				233-243	"            Induction of synchronous grammars from empirical data has
long been an unsolved problem; despite generative synchronous grammars
theoretically suit the machine translation task very well. This fact is mainly
due to pervasive structural divergences between languages. This paper presents
a statistical approach that learns dependency structure mappings from parallel
corpora. The new algorithm automatically learns parallel dependency treelet pairs from loosely matched non-isomorphic
dependency trees while keeping computational complexity polynomial in the
length of the sentences. A set of heuristics is introduced and specifically
optimized for parallel treelet learning purposes
using Minimum Error Rate training."	Selected abstracts
Practical translation pattern acquisition from combined language resources	Mihoko Kitamura and Yuji Matsumoto				244-253	"            Automatic extraction of translation patterns from
parallel corpora is an efficient way to automatically develop translation
dictionaries, and therefore various approaches have been proposed. This paper
presents a practical translation pattern extraction method that greedily
extracts translation patterns based on co-occurrence of English and Japanese
word sequences, which can also be effectively combined with manual confirmation
and linguistic resources, such as chunking information and translation
dictionaries. Use of these extra linguistic resources enables it to acquire
results of higher precision and broader coverage regardless of the amount of
documents."	Selected abstracts
An English-Hindi statistical machine translation system	Raghavendra Udupa U. and Tanveer A.Faruquie				254-262	"            Recently statistical methods for natural language
translation have become popular and found reasonable success. In this paper we
describe an English-Hindi statistical machine translation system. Our machine
translation system is based on IBM Models 1, 2, and 3. We present experimental
results on an English-Hindi parallel corpus consisting of 150,000 sentence
pairs. We propose two new algorithms for the transfer of fertility parameters
from Model 2 to Model 3. Our algorithms have a worst case time complexity of O(m3) improving on the exponential
time algorithm proposed in the classical paper on IBM Models. When the maximum
fertility of a word is small, our algorithms are O(m2)
and hence very efficient in practice."	Selected abstracts
Natural language database access using semi-automatically constructed translation knowledge	In-Su Kang and Jae-Hak J.Bae and Jong-Hyeok Lee				280-289	"            In most natural language database interfaces (NLDBI),
translation knowledge acquisition heavily depends on human specialties,
consequently undermining domain portability. This paper attempts to
semi-automatically construct translation knowledge by introducing a physical
Entity-Relationship schema, and by simplifying translation knowledge
structures. Based on this semi-automatically produced translation knowledge, a
noun translation method is proposed in order to resolve NLDBI translation
ambiguities."	Selected abstracts
Influence of WSD on cross-language information retrieval	In-Su Kang and Seung-Hoon Na and Jong-Hyeok Lee				358-366	"Translation
ambiguity is a major problem in dictionary-based cross-language information
retrieval. This paper proposes a statistical word sense disambiguation (WSD)
approach for translation ambiguity resolution. Then, with respect to CLIR
effectiveness, the pure effect of a disambiguation module will be explored on the
following issues: contribution of disambiguation weight to target term weighting, influences of WSD performance on CLIR retrieval
effectiveness. In our investigation, we do not use pre-translation or
post-translation methods to exclude any mixing effects on CLIR."	Selected abstracts
Bilingual chunk alignment based on interactional matching and probabilistic latent semantic indexing	Feifan Liu and Qianli Jin and Jun Zhao and Bo Xu				416-425	"            An integrated method for bilingual chunk partition and
alignment, called Interactional Matching, is proposed in this paper. Different from former works,
our method tries to get as necessary information as possible from the bilingual
corpora themselves, and through bilingual constraint it can automatically build
one-to-one chunk-pairs associated with the chunk-pair confidence coefficients.
Also, our method partitions bilingual sentences entirely into chunks with no
fragments left, different from collocation extracting methods. Furthermore,
with the technology of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (PLSI), this
method can deal with not only compositional chunks, but also non-compositional
ones. The experiments show that, for overall process (including partition and
alignment), our method can obtain 85% precision with 57% recall for the written
language chunk-pairs and 78% precision with 53% recall for the spoken language
chunk-pairs."	Selected abstracts
